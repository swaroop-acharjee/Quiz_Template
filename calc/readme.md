# Calculator

A minimal — but fonctionnal — calculator, written with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  
It follows Google's [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).  
  
You can see a [**live DEMO here**](https://mkspcd.github.io/CalculatorJS/).  
  
The user can either :

- use his **mouse** and click on the buttons (a click on the result resets the calculator),
- type on his **keyboard** to use the calculator.

Original design by *[Ruban Khalid](https://dribbble.com/shots/2321336-Calculator-004-Daily-UI)*.  
I integrated his design and slightly modified it for my needs.  

I used the [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) framework only to add an effect when a button is clicked.
